Additional Steps for Firebase Configuration
Since CyberSoochna uses Firebase for its backend services, you may need to set up Firebase services:

1. Firebase Project Setup
Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

2. Add Firebase SDK
Configure your Firebase project by adding the Firebase SDK to your project. Update your `.env` file with your Firebase project credentials.

3. Deploy Firebase Functions (Optional)
If you have Firebase functions that need to be deployed, navigate to the functions directory and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd functions
   npm install
   firebase deploy --only functions
   ```
## Usage
Configuration of your firebase account. Login to your google account and create a new firebase project [click here](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)

Create a FirebaseConfig.js file and add the following variables:
SAMPLE CONFIG, you should put the actual config details found on your project settings.
```
      const firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "yourapikey",
        authDomain: "yourauthdomin.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "yourdburl.firebasedatabase.app/",
        projectId: "yourproject-id",
        storageBucket: "yourstoragebucket.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "yourmessageid",
        appId: "1:370994734512:web:3e82c1a31746693779e275",
        measurementId: "G-STG4B5C20Z"
      };
   ``` 
After setting up necessary configuration, create a Realtime Database and start the development server.
